mimicking the pure compositional bliss of the age-old typewriter.

## Features

* Saves files as pure text (.txt) using a subset of UTF-8.
* "Portable." The app is self-contained and can run from a flash drive.
* Free Software (libre). Fully GPL'd so you keep your freedom. (See "License.")

## FAQs

### Why the name "candlestick"?

According to "A Dictionary of Typography and Its Accessory Arts" by John Southward:
> **Candlestick.**—In former times, when compositors worked at night by the light of candles, they used a candlestick loaded at the base to keep it steady. It was invariably placed in the lower-case *c* box. A few offices use them at the present day.

It seemed fitting that an app written for writers should have a meaningful name,
harkening back to the good ol' days where writing meant lighting the candle and
simply composing thoughts late into the night, with no distractions.

The logo borrows from this definition of candlestick and represents a physical
letter *c* that would be found in the lower-case *c* box.

### Why pure text (.txt)?

A writer's workflow should consist of writing. A novel concept. If the text is
stored in anything other than a pure text file, that means other data is stored
along with it (such as formatting, fonts, etc). But, the writer's first goal
is to get type on the page.

Using pure text ensures that all other programs can read it without issue.

### Why can't I edit?

Consider the **candlestick app** to be a writer's journal. Just **pen and paper**.
*Just write.*

Editing, formatting, typesetting—these things should come after the initial idea;
they are their own process with their own techniques. It is better to use other
apps that focus on these processes once the initial writing is done.

Several famous novelists use typewriters to this day because of the completely
writing focused environment. Forcing yourself to "just write" fosters creativity
and an environment where the thoughts can flow continually onto the page without
the constant interruption of editing or the like.

(See Dr. Betty Edwards's "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" for more info
on the creative process and workflow; cf. Kimon Nicolaides.)

### How is "candlestick" cross-platform?

Candlestick comes in three flavors: Windows, Mac, and Linux. Each app
runs identically and natively on the system, ensuring that the writing
experience is the same regardless of the computer platform.

## Technology

Candlestick is written in C and uses OpenGL and Freetype 2 so there
is no reliance on the system's user-interface.
