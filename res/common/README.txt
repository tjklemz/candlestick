Welcome to Candlestick!

Candlestick is a minimalist, focused writing app.
It has a few basic commands:

Save        Control-s
Open        Control-o (use the arrow keys to move, hit enter to open)
Fullscreen  Control-f (optionally press the Escape key to exit)
Quit        Control-q (or close the app)

And that's it! Your documents are saved as pure text in the "documents" folder next to where the application lives.

Oh, and use the arrow keys to scroll through your document, if you'd like. Candlestick keeps the current line in the middle of your screen when you're typing (like a typewriter).

The app is completely portable. Run it off of a flash drive or place it anywhere on your computer.

Enjoy!
